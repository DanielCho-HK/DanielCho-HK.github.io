I'm a PhD candidate from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I mainly research deep learning-based computer graphics and computer vision. My current work focuses on line drawing colorization, non-photorealistic animation generation, garment sewing pattern reconstruction from the 3D point cloud, and single image-based 3D object reconstruction. I'm now working in the [Computer Graphics Group/Visual System Lab](http://graphics.csie.ncku.edu.tw/) under the supervision of Prof. [Tong-Yee Lee](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=V3PTB98AAAAJ&hl=zh-TW).
