I got PhD from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) in 2025. I mainly conduct research in deep learning-based computer graphics and computer vision. My current work focuses on line drawing colorization, non-photorealistic animation generation, garment sewing pattern reconstruction from the 3D point cloud, and single image-based 3D object reconstruction.
