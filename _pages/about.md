I'm a final year PhD student from [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). I mainly conduct research on deep learning-based computer graphics and computer vision. My current work focuses on line drawing colorization, non-photorealistic animation generation, garment sewing pattern reconstruction from the 3D point cloud, and single image-based 3D object reconstruction.
